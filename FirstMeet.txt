Iterative is better
Agile is too much for us to meet. Schedules not	open enough

Control decentralized
We decided to program in
Program language might not be able to run on all machines (OSX, Linux, Windows)
Any questions on requirements?
Are we allowed to have multiple tabs on the GUI?
Yes as long as it meets the requirements and its in the SRS. 
Make keys for each profile
Change in speed clarification?
Account for acceleration, deceleration, constant speed
What is the deliverable?
